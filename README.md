# 🧠 Mind You Mind (MYM)

**Mind You Mind (MYM)** is a smart, emotionally aware virtual companion designed to listen, understand, and support users by analyzing their voice input — both in terms of words and emotions.  
Built as a response to growing emotional fatigue in the digital age, MYM blends **speech emotion recognition**, **AI-powered transcription**, and **friendly, empathetic responses** to help users feel heard and uplifted.

## 💡 What Does It Do?

- 🎙️ **Accepts Voice Input** – Users can speak their thoughts naturally.
- 🧠 **Emotion Detection** – A deep learning model predicts the emotional state from voice (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.).
- 📝 **Speech-to-Text** – Audio is transcribed using the Deepgram API.
- 💬 **Supportive AI Response** – Using Google's Gemini AI, MYM generates a kind, caring response in the tone of a best friend or virtual therapist.
- ❤️ **Emotionally Intelligent Interaction** – The system isn’t just smart — it’s warm, intuitive, and psychologically sensitive.
